Questions Attempted: 1 - 20

Special Instructions: 

Nothing really, everything is pretty straight forward. have output in the files itself.

Challenges faced:

1. ALIGNMENT: Aligning the right border (║) in the boxed formatting was difficult when variable lengths changed. Solved this by converting values to strings and using " " * (width - length) math. Also used ^ for center align formatting

2. Age Calculator: Had to use new package and learn new logic to build the program.

3. Print formatting: Took more time to make output look prettier than building the logic itself.

4. Edge cases: finding edge cases and fixing bugs accordingly(not a big challenge).
